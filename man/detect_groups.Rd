\title{Detect groups by sample names}
\usage{
detect_groups(sample_names, sample_info = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_names}{Vector of column headings from data file or design file}

\item{sample_info}{Matrix of the experiment design information}
}
\value{
A character vector with the groups. Returns "Samples" for all samples
 when no meaningful grouping pattern is detected.
}
\description{
Detects groups from column names in sample info file so that they can be used
for things such as coloring plots or building the model for DEG analysis.
If there are too many unique groups (80% or more samples in their own group),
the function acknowledges there are no meaningful sample groups and returns
"Samples" for all samples to prevent legend overflow in plots.
}
\note{
This function is mainly called internally in other idepGolem functions.

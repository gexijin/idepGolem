\title{Detect groups by sample names}
\usage{
detect_groups(sample_names, sample_info = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_names}{Vector of column headings from data file or design file}

\item{sample_info}{Matrix of the experiment design information}
}
\value{
A character vector with the groups. Non-replicated groups become "Other",
 and if all groups are non-replicated, all return as "Samples". Long group names
 (>30 characters) are truncated.
}
\description{
Detects groups from column names in sample info file so that they can be used
for things such as coloring plots or building the model for DEG analysis.
Groups with only one sample (no replicates) are labeled as "Other". If all
samples end up as "Other" (no groups have replicates), they are relabeled as
"Samples" to prevent legend overflow in plots. Group names longer than 30
characters are truncated to improve plot readability.
}
\note{
This function is mainly called internally in other idepGolem functions.
 A warning is shown if any group names are truncated.
}

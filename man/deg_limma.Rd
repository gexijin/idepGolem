\arguments{
\item{processed_data}{Data that has been through the pre-processing}

\item{max_p_limma}{Significant p-value to use for the fold-change
values}

\item{min_fc_limma}{Minimum fold-change to include in the results}

\item{raw_counts}{The matrix of counts before processing for
gene expression data}

\item{counts_deg_method}{The method or package being used for
the DEG analysis}

\item{prior_counts}{The constant added to the log transformation
from pre-processing}

\item{data_file_format}{Type of gene data being examined}

\item{selected_comparisons}{Selected comparisons to analyze
in the DEG analysis}

\item{sample_info}{Experiment file information for grouping}

\item{model_factors}{Vector of selected factors and interaction terms
from the model design}

\item{block_factor}{The selected factors for batch effect}

\item{reference_levels}{Vector of reference levels to use for the
selected factors (e.g., c("genotype:wt", "treatment:control"))}
}
\value{
The return value is the results of the DEG analysis. These
 results are filtered and formatted by the limma_value function.
        processed_data = processed_data,
}
\description{
Used in the limma_value function to perform DEG analysis using the
limma package. It is not recommended to use this function on its own.

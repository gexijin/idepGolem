<h3>
    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The PCA tab summarizes sample-to-sample relationships using principal
    component analysis and complementary ordination methods. Select axes,
    overlay sample annotations, and download figures or the underlying scores
    to document trends discovered during exploratory analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Principal component analysis projects the high-dimensional gene expression
    matrix into new orthogonal axes (principal components) that capture as much
    variance as possible. Samples that cluster together in the plot share
    similar expression patterns, while samples that fall far apart differ in
    the combination of genes that separate them. Each axis is labeled with the
    percentage of total variance it explains, indicating how much of the dataâ€™s
    structure is summarized along that direction.
</p>
<h3>
    2D PCA Plot
</h3>
<p>
    The main PCA panel shows an interactive two-dimensional scatter plot built
    with Plotly. Choose the principal components for each axis using the
    dropdown menus in the sidebar. Sample color and shape can be mapped to any
    metadata column that was supplied during preprocessing, making it easy to
    highlight experimental factors.
</p>
<p>
    Interpretation tips: look for separation of experimental groups along the
    axes, check whether replicates cluster tightly, and inspect outliers that
    may represent mislabeled samples or technical artifacts. The direction of
    separation hints at which genes (loadings) contribute to the variation, and
    additional plots in the PCAtools tab can be used to inspect those genes in
    detail.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Hover to inspect individual samples; the tooltip displays sample name
        and group membership.
    </li>
    <li>
        The correlation text beneath the plot reports which factors align most
        strongly with the selected principal components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the download control under the plot to export publication-quality
        images with custom dimensions.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3D PCA
</h3>
<p>
    The 3D tab renders an interactive three-dimensional PCA view. Select the
    three components of interest and rotate the plot to reveal sample
    separation patterns that may not be obvious in two dimensions.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The same color and shape mappings apply, so factor selections made in
        the sidebar stay in sync across tabs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Since the plot is fully interactive, use the Plotly toolbar to orbit,
        zoom, and capture static images.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    PCAtools Suite
</h3>
<p>
    The PCAtools tab provides additional diagnostics generated by the
    <em>PCAtools</em> package. Configure X and Y axes, point aesthetics, and
    optional loadings overlays directly from the sidebar.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The biplot overlays feature loadings when enabled, illustrating which
        genes drive the separation between samples.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scree and variance importance plots display how much variation each
        component explains, helping decide how many PCs to interpret.
    </li>
    <li>
        Eigencor plots correlate principal components with sample annotations
        to highlight biologically meaningful axes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    MDS and t-SNE
</h3>
<p>
    Alternative ordination methods are available on the MDS and t-SNE tabs.
    They use the same processed expression matrix but reveal structure with
    distance-based (MDS) or nonlinear (t-SNE) embeddings.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In t-SNE, use the <strong>Re-calculate</strong> button to run the
        algorithm with a new random seed when clusters appear unstable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Download controls under each plot provide quick access to the
        underlying data or figure.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Reports and Data
</h3>
<p>
    The sidebar includes buttons to generate an HTML report summarizing the PCA
    analyses and to download the PCA scores data table for offline inspection
    or custom plotting.
</p>
<h3>
    Quick Tips
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Explore multiple component pairs; secondary PCs often capture batch or
        condition effects that PC1/PC2 miss.
    </li>
    <li>
        Align color and shape selections with your experimental design to make
        group separation easier to interpret.
    </li>
    <li>
        Switch to the PCAtools scree plot when deciding how many PCs to retain
        for downstream analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the correlation summaries to confirm that observed clusters match
        known sample annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remember to widen the browser window or collapse the sidebar when
        plots feel cramped.
    </li>
</ul>

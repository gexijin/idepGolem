<h3>
    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The PCA tab is a quick way to see which samples behave alike and which ones
    stand out. It condenses the thousands of genes measured in your experiment
    into easy-to-read plots, so you can spot patterns without any coding or
    statistics.
</p>
<p>
    Principal component analysis (PCA) works by re-arranging the data so that
    the biggest differences between samples appear on the horizontal and
    vertical axes. When two samples sit close together on the plot they share
    similar gene-expression profiles. Samples that land far apart are reacting
    differently to the conditions in your study. Each axis label includes the
    percentage of "variation" it captures—higher percentages mean that axis is
    explaining more of the overall differences between samples.
</p>
<h3>
    2D PCA Plot
</h3>
<p>
    The first panel shows an interactive two-dimensional scatter plot. Use the
    drop-down menus in the sidebar to choose which axes (principal components)
    you want to view. You can color or shape the points by any sample
    annotation, such as treatment group, time point, or tissue type, to check
    whether your experimental design explains the separation you see.
</p>
<p>
    How to interpret the plot:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Samples that cluster together likely responded similarly and can be
        considered consistent replicates.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a supposed replicate falls far from the others, double-check that
        sample for labeling or quality issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Separation between treatment groups suggests that the intervention had a
        measurable effect on global expression patterns.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Hover your mouse over a point to see the sample name and group.
    </li>
    <li>
        The text below the plot highlights which sample annotations align most
        strongly with the current axes.
    </li>

        Use the download button to save the plot with custom dimensions for
        presentations or reports.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3D PCA
</h3>
<p>
    The 3D tab shows a rotating three-dimensional version of the PCA plot. Pick
    any three components and drag the plot to view it from different angles. The
    color and shape options you chose in the sidebar carry over automatically.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use the toolbar inside the plot to rotate, zoom, or capture a snapshot.
    </li>
    <li>
        3D views are especially helpful when two groups overlap in 2D but separate
        when a third axis is added.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    PCAtools Suite
</h3>
<p>
    Additional tabs powered by the <em>PCAtools</em> package provide deeper
    diagnostics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Biplot:</strong> adds arrows showing which genes influence sample
        placement. Enable loadings in the sidebar to reveal these drivers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scree and variance plots:</strong> display how much variation each
        principal component explains, helping you decide how many components to
        keep in downstream work.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Eigencor plot:</strong> compares each component against your sample
        annotations (for example, treatment or batch) and highlights strong
        relationships.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    MDS and t-SNE
</h3>
<p>
    The MDS and t-SNE tabs offer alternative views of the same processed data.
    MDS (multidimensional scaling) focuses on overall distances, while t-SNE is a
    nonlinear method that can uncover tight clusters.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Click <strong>Re-calculate</strong> on the t-SNE tab to try a new random
        seed if the clusters look unstable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Download options under each plot let you save the figures or the data
        points for further exploration.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Reports and Data
</h3>
<p>
    Buttons in the sidebar generate an HTML summary of the PCA results and let
    you download the PCA scores table. The table is useful for custom plots or
    for cross-checking how individual samples load onto each component.
</p>
<h3>
    Quick Tips
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Try several axis combinations—important biology can appear on later
        components, not just PC1 vs PC2.
    </li>
    <li>
        Match colors and shapes with your experimental design so clusters are
        easier to explain to collaborators.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the PCAtools scree plot to justify how many components you keep in
        downstream analysis or presentations.
    </li>
    <li>
        If clusters are unclear, consider returning to the Pre-Process tab to
        adjust filtering or transformations and re-run PCA.
    </li>
    <li>
        Widen your browser window or collapse the sidebar if plots feel crowded.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The Bicluster tab searches for groups of genes that behave similarly across only a
    subset of samples. This can uncover condition-specific co-expression patterns that
    standard clustering (which uses all samples) may miss. Biclustering generally works
    best when you have at least 15 samples and more than two experimental groups.
</p>
<p>
    The methods implemented here come from the
    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biclust/index.html" target="_blank">biclust</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QUBIC.html" target="_blank">QUBIC</a>
    R packages.

        <strong>Most variable genes to include:</strong> limits the analysis to the most
        variable genes across samples. Using 500â€“1000 genes often balances runtime and
        signal.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Method:</strong> select a biclustering algorithm. Each has different
        strengths:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BCCC / BCQuest / BCXmotifs / BCPlaid / BCSpectral / BCBimax:</strong>
                algorithms from the <em>biclust</em> package with varied assumptions about
                cluster shapes (additive, plaid, spectral, binary).</li>
            <li><strong>QUBIC:</strong> robust to noise; excels at finding binary expression
                patterns (high/low blocks).</li>
            <li><strong>runibic (BCUnibic):</strong> detects trend-preserving biclusters where
                genes follow similar ordering across samples.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Select a cluster:</strong> after the algorithm runs, choose which bicluster to
        examine. The info box below the selector summarises how many genes and samples are in
        the cluster.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Heatmap Tab
</h3>
<p>
    Displays the expression values for genes and samples within the selected bicluster. Rows
    are clustered to highlight internal structure; colour scales come from the Pre-Process
    settings. Use the heatmap to check whether the bicluster isolates a distinct pattern.
</p>
<h3>
    Enrichment Tab
</h3>
<p>
    Runs functional enrichment on the genes inside the bicluster, using the same enrichment
    module as other parts of iDEP. This helps you interpret whether the bicluster represents a
    particular pathway, transcription factor target set, or biological process.
</p>
<h3>
    Genes Tab
</h3>
<p>
    Lists the gene members of the bicluster along with any available annotations. Use the
    download button to export the table for downstream analysis or validation.

<h3>
    Practical Tips
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Biclustering can be computationally intensive; start with fewer genes and expand if you
        find promising patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
        Different methods may return different numbers of biclusters. Try a few algorithms to see
        which captures the biology of your dataset.
    </li>
    <li>
        Because biclusters focus on subsets of samples, always check that the identified samples
        share a meaningful biological condition (for example, a treatment arm or time point).
    </li>
    <li>
        Some methods (like plaid models) can produce overlapping biclusters; use the info panel to
        track how many genes and samples overlap across clusters.
    </li>
</ul>

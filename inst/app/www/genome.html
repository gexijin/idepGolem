<h3>
    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The Genome tab shows where your fold-changes of genes along
    each chromosome. It also scans for genomic regions where many neighbouring genes
    change together, highlighting potential co-regulation or shared copy-number
    events. The controls on the left let you choose the comparison, gene filters, and
    window settings used in these plots.
</p>
<h3>
    Gene-Level Filters
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Comparison selector:</strong> choose a Stats contrast (formatted as
        “B-A”, meaning fold change relative to A). “All” combines all genes regardless
        of contrast for quick exploration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Genes: FDR</strong> and <strong>Min. Fold Change:</strong> set the
        adjusted p-value and fold-change cutoffs that determine which genes appear as
        coloured points on the chromosome plot. Red dots mark up-regulated genes, blue
        dots mark down-regulated genes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Label genes:</strong> check to display gene symbols as you hover over or
        zoom into the plot.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Coding genes only:</strong> include or exclude non-coding genes depending
        on whether you want to focus on protein-coding events.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hide patch chromosomes:</strong> removes alternative assemblies (patches)
        so the plot focuses on primary chromosomes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hide chromosomes with 4 or fewer genes:</strong> suppresses sparsely
        populated chromosomes to keep the figure tidy.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Sliding-Window Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    Beneath the basic filters you can search for chromosomal regions where many genes
    change together.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Window Size (Mb):</strong> width of the sliding window used to scan the
        genome (for example, 6 Mb).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steps:</strong> number of sub-steps within each window. A larger value
        increases overlap between windows (for example, window 0–6 Mb, then 2–8 Mb when
        steps=3).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>FDR cutoff for window:</strong> significance threshold applied to the
        average fold-change t-test performed within each window. Windows passing this
        cutoff are drawn as red (up) or blue (down) line segments alongside the
        chromosome.

        <strong>Download Plot Data:</strong> export the table of windows and gene
        statistics for offline use.

<h3>
    Plot Interaction
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Zoom:</strong> drag across a chromosome to zoom; double-click to reset.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hover:</strong> mouse over points to see gene ID, symbol, strand, and
        exact coordinates.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Menu:</strong> use the Plotly toolbar (upper-right) to download PNG/SVG
        images or reset the view.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Interpretation Tips
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Window-based enrichment treats a genomic segment like a gene set. Significant
        segments suggest coordinated regulation and are independent of the DEG cutoffs
        above because all analysed genes contribute to the t-test.
    </li>
    <li>
        Look for clusters of red or blue segments—they often correspond to known loci
        (for example, immune clusters, chromosomal amplifications, or deletions).
    </li>
    <li>
        Adjust window size and steps: large windows capture broad trends, while smaller
        windows detect focal events.
    </li>
    <li>
        If no regions appear, try relaxing the FDR cutoff or fold-change filters.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Limitations
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Chromosome lengths are based on the coordinates of the last gene in the dataset;
        telomeres or centromeres are not drawn explicitly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Results depend on annotation quality. If gene IDs did not map cleanly during
        preprocessing, affected loci may be under-represented.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The DEG tab helps you inspect each contrast produced in Stats. Select a
    comparison to review significant genes, visualize fold changes, and run
    enrichment analyses. Stats defines the comparisons; DEG explains what each
    comparison means biologically.
</p>
<h3>
    Selecting a Contrast
</h3>
<p>
    Use the menu on the left to pick any contrast from Stats. Labels follow the
    “B-A” convention (for example, “Drug-Control”), meaning fold changes are
    calculated relative to the baseline group (Control in this example).
    Interaction contrasts start with “I:” and test whether the effect of one
    factor depends on another.
</p>
<h3>
    Heatmap
</h3>
<p>
    The default view is a clustered heatmap of differentially expressed genes.
    Choose how many genes to display and whether to sort them by fold change or
    FDR. Download buttons provide both the image and the underlying expression
    matrix for custom plots or reporting.
</p>
<h3>
    Volcano, MA, and Scatter Plots
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Volcano plot:</strong> highlights genes with large fold changes and
        strong statistical support. Use the labeling controls to tag genes of
        interest.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>MA plot:</strong> shows fold change versus mean expression, making it
        easy to spot intensity-dependent effects.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scatter plot:</strong> compares fold changes between two contrasts
        when both are available, helping you see shared responses.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each plot offers download options so you can save high-resolution figures or
    export the data points behind them.
</p>
<h3>
    Enrichment
</h3>
<p>
    The Enrichment tab connects directly to the pathway analysis module. For the
    selected contrast, you can run GO, pathway, and TF/miRNA target enrichment.
    This helps translate lists of DEGs into biological processes and regulatory
    themes. Adjust settings exactly as you would elsewhere in iDEP.
</p>
<h3>
    R Code
    </h3>
<p>
    DEG also provides the R script used to generate plots and tables. Download
    it if you want to customize visualizations or rerun the analysis offline.
</p>
<h3>
    Tips
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        If a contrast is missing, return to Stats and confirm it was selected in the
        Experiment Design page before rerunning the analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interpret fold changes with the baseline in mind; “Drug-Control” reports
        expression in Drug relative to Control.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the heatmap download to share gene clusters with collaborators or feed
        selected genes into downstream pathway tools.
    </li>
</ul>
